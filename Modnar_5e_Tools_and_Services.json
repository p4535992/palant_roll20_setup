Normally a Large-sized weapon deals double the damage die (e.g. a large greataxe deals 2d12 instead of 1d12) but this might be considered overpowered for a player.

It's difficult to obtain achaierai meat as in some places the fiends bodies vanish on death to their respective lower planes, but in places where the corpse survives the meat can be harvested. The meat is tough enough to dull typical iron knives, and so many pre-cook the meat in a slow cooker to tenderize it, then grill it afterword. This is also done because the temperatures needed to properly cook the meat is higher than most, near the melting point of iron, and as such it is often cooked in blacksmith's furnaces. However once properly prepared it is a delicious and rich smoky flavor which 'tastes like chicken'. Care is needed in cooking. If undercooked the eater suffers as if they had been exposed to the achaierai black cloud ability. However when properly cooked the eater gains the ability to use the achaierai's black cloud ability once. Multiple meals do not stack, so a creature can only have one black cloud at a time.",
