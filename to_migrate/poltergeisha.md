To use these macros, it is best to make a character sheet called "Party Sheet" and give all the players access to it. Put these macros
in the sheet as Abilities (which are like sheet-specific macros.) When your players want to shop, they can just open up the Attributes tab
of the Party Sheet to access the macros, or start typing %shopping in chat to bring up the menu.

Copy EVERYTHING between the lines (but not the lines) and name them EXACTLY as is.
